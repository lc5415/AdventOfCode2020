# So I'm kinda mad at myself for having spent so many days at the relationships between the iput length and the count of possible sub arrays. In the end the long long input only has 3 contiguous changeable ones at most hence I can just use a lookup table, well basically I know that for 3 continuous ones there are 7 (2^3 -1) possible valid arrangements instead of 8, if it's 2 continuous ones it's just 2
